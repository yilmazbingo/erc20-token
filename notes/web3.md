We have Metamask running inside browser. Whenever metamask is running inside of your browser, it automatically injects the web3 library into any active page. Note inorder to communicate with any ethereum network, web3 needs a provider. 

Metamask has access to our all of the account keys, public and private. Provider stores account keys. Metamask used provides V-0.2.0 but as of 2021, it injects your app's web3 instance. 

- We already deployed our contract to rinkeby network. now we are going to access that, get the Contract Abi and feed it into the web3.
